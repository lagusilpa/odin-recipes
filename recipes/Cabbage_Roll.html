    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p id="description">Cabbage Roll Casserole is a simple bake composed of a rich and meaty tomato-based sauce, layered in a dish with rice and semi-cooked strips of cabbage. Covered tightly and baked in a moderate oven, the flavors mingle together to create something which is quite delicious, homey, and comforting. I have worked for years to perfect this recipe. It is the result of about 35 years of trial and error and scrupulous testing to get it exactly right. This bake is never soupy, or sloppy. The cabbage is perfectly soft. The flavors are spot on in my opinion.

    <p id="description">I never used to top it with cheese, because let <q></q> face it, cheese is not normally seen in cabbage rolls. After seeing a few other cooks adding a final layer of cheese, I tried it myself a few years ago. Whilst not traditional, I had to admit it was a very scrumptious addition. It became a part of my casserole that I now never leave out.</p>
